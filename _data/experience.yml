# Senior Cloud Architect Consultant
- company: NTT Data (North America)
  position: Senior Cloud Architect Consultant (remote)
  duration: Apr, 2024 &mdash; Present
  summary: Since joining NTT Data, i've leveraged my expertise as an cloud architect in Google Cloud to deliver impactful solution across various industries to different clients in North America (at the time of writing  - November 2024 - three major clients).<br />One client that i've worked with, was a major agricultural player which had a target to use their on-prem data with GCP Vertex AI.  In order to achieve their goal, I had to create a <b>landing zone</b> in Google Cloud, involve all the business stakeholders in order to sync data from different platform such as SAP, Salesforce, different in-house applications and different SaaS to BigQuery. Another project which i was involved in was a client, one of the biggest logistic company in US, which wanted to migrate certain CI/CD pipeline jobs from Azure DevOps on-prem server to ADO (Azure DevOps Services). I designed and implemented robust CI/CD pipelines using their existing tools and adapting different services, to the newly Cloud setup. Furthermore, I facilitated the successful implementation of Apigee within Google Cloud for a leading home automation company, a subsidiary of a major industrial conglomerate. This involved designing and deploying cloud resources in an initial landing zone, then implementing the Apigee setup, managing API traffic, and ensuring secure communication between their IoT devices and cloud backend.
