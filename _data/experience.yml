  position: Cloud Architect
  duration: Jun, 2022 &mdash; Present
  summary: As a Cloud Architect at Regnology, I took a leadership role in orchestrating the migration from on-premises to the cloud. My initial responsibilities involved designing and preparing the entire cloud infrastructure for the seamless transition, a task that encompassed migrating approximately 130 on-premises servers and arround 50 servers from diffrent cloud providers (OCI, AWS and Azure) to Google Cloud. <br />Taking charge of the cloud evolution, I introduced efficiency and agility by automating the deployment of new resources using Terraform, ensuring a swift and standardized approach to scaling our infrastructure. In tandem, I've maintained and updated the cloud infrastructure to align with the evolving needs of our developers and clients, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization. <br />In this dynamic role, I extensively utilized a diverse technology stack, including Terraform, GCP, Azure, Okta, Jenkins, Python, Bash and Microsoft Power Platform, PowerBI. This holistic approach has empowered me to navigate the intricacies of multi-cloud environments, implement robust identity and access management solutions, streamline CI/CD pipelines for enhanced development workflows, create automation scripts and solutions, and provide reports for management and users. <br />In my continuous pursuit of excellence, I actively try to stay up to date to the latest technologies and trends. This commitment to innovation has allowed me to successfully implement cutting-edge solutions into our day-to-day business workflow, contributing to Regnology's technological prowess and future-readiness.
